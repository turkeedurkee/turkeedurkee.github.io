                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Today began like any other day on Mars: awoken dim and early by the blasting of a select song
                    from the Futurama soundtrack. We stirred ourselves some hot chocolate – the only dehydrated
                    food we seem to have an abundance of – and gathered around the window to watch the sunrise.
                    Once the sun peeked out from its azimuthal hiding spot, it seemed we were already in a rush to
                    eat breakfast and prepare for our first EVA of the day.
                    </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With this being our 6th EVA, we were already pros at the process. Myself, Shefali, and Cesare
                    were suited up, depressurized, and revving up the rovers in 15 minutes flat. Our goal for this
                    EVA was to head south of the Hab. Not for warmer pastures, but for a signal analysis
                    experiment. My research involves measuring ambient radio signals around the Hab, so we were
                    testing whether or not the ridge between the Hab and our destination would have a dampening
                    effect on such signals.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The ridge in question is called Kissing Camel Ridge, supposedly named because the rock
                    formations look like two titular camels face to face. However, I adamantly believe that anyone
                    who claims to see two camels there is either a fraud or suffering from terminal "Emperor’s New
                    Clothes" Syndrome.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We accomplished our own personal research goals in the area and spent our remaining time
                    capturing pictures of the grandiose landscape. Admittedly also a few (hundred) pictures of each
                    other in fabulous poses. We loaded back up the rovers with our cumbersome equipment and
                    slogged back to base. The roads today are swampy concoctions of mud and slushy ice under the
                    facade of neatly laid snow. We returned home cold, muddy, and accomplished.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As soon as we escaped our life-saving mobile prisons (that we are very grateful for), we tagged
                    in the next EVA crew. Pat, seismologist extraordinaire, and LuzMa, dehydrated mango
                    connoisseur performed an engineering maintenance EVA while they waited for the rovers to
                    recharge. Once T and Custy had drunk their fill of our precious electricity, they valiantly carried
                    the two Marstronauts to their goal. That goal being: south. Just slightly farther south than we had
                    ventured. Always one-upping us, those two.
                    </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After performing a long series of geophonic tests that we Hab-dwellers could intermittently hear
                    over the radios, they too braved the earthy sludge on their homeward bound. They got back to
                    breathable air just in time to join the sequel to yesterday’s fire brigade! We had waited a majority
                    of the day to ferry water in the hopes that the pipes would thaw, but no dice. On the bright side,
                    since we had used some of yesterday’s water to wash the dishes, we had a multitude of clean
                    pots and other water receptacles for our thirst-fueled operation.
                    </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1000 rotations of dumping pots and slamming my head into the low ceiling later, our water was
                    at a more than acceptable level. We filled it up a bit extra so that people had the opportunity to
                    shower before our New Year’s festivities if desired. A few people seized the hygienic
                    opportunity, and then we spontaneously dove into a viewing of Shrek.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As a neutral journalistic observer, I must report that tensions are beginning to rise. There may be
                    a formation of factions between those who want to watch Mulan next and those who would
                    prefer Hot Fuzz. The first Martian Civil War breweth.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The other thing beginning to rise is our rosemary bread for the great New Year’s feast! Very
                    soon we will put aside our differences and eat the vast majority of our remaining food supply.
                    It’s strange to celebrate the anniversary of the Earth’s revolution around the sun from its
                    planetary next-door neighbor. There’s no way I’d rather spend it than breaking Hab-made bread
                    with my fellow crewmates.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What a fantastic way to usher in the new decade. Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
